                          Project-based Environment


                                   PURPOSE


This text documents my current ways to achieve project-based environment with 
the following conditions and rationales:

0. Using :mksession to save and command-line option -S to restore

   It's built-in functionality.

1. Not using plugins

   I do not wish to additional plugins to preserve/restore.

2. Not using user vimrc

   Projects come and go, and every project has different needs/settings, vimrc 
   would be a mess after numerous projects additions/removals.

3. Not using exrc feature

   Security and it's not enabled by default.


                                  IMPLEMENTS


Instead of loading a session file which created by :mksession, I create a 
startup.vim, for example:

  %bw
  let s:vimfiles = expand('<sfile>:p:h') . '/'
  let &spellfile= s:vimfiles . 'spell.utf-8.add,~/.vim/spell/en.utf-8.add'
  exec ':nnoremap <F2> :mksession! ' . s:vimfiles . 'sessions.vim<CR>'
  exec 'source ' . s:vimfiles . 'sessions.vim'

One reason for using startup.vim is shown in the example above, the :mksession 
does not save options with names in all lower cases, in this case, option 
spellfile.  It also makes a key to simplify the session saving.
