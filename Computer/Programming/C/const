                                    const


                               const char * ch;
                               char * const ch;


Read from right, ch is a:

1. (*) pointer to (char) (const)ant variable.
2. (const)ant (*) pointer to (char) variable.

From there,

1. ch points to a constant char, itself is mutable, but not the pointed char.
2. ch is a constant pointer, that is immutable, but the char is mutable.


                            const char * const ch;


Never seen anyone wrote that.
