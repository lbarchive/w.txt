                                  comma too


This page is about using a comma for the adverb too (meaning also) in the end 
of sentence.  English is my second language, and I do believe that I was 
taught to use comma before too, for example:

  I was taught to use comma, too.

This style, I believe, is the American English, the British doesn't use comma 
[1].  However, it would seem not all Americans would follow the rules, as you 
can read in this Q&A in The Chicago Manual of Style Online [2].

There are some arguments on using commas for American who doesn't use comma -- 
note that, the two are mutually exclusive:

1. Emphases
2. Making meaning clear

   Some are using comma to make things clear as asked in the previous [2].  
   But I found it's just an out-of-context issue.  For example,

     I speak English too.

   This could mean:
   
     1. John speaks English.  I speak English too.
     2. Chinese is my first language.  I speak English too.

   When you yank a line with adverb too without context lines, ambiguity 
   arises.  If you want a comma-before-too to make things clear, I doubt 
   that's a wise idea because it could go either meaning for with or without a 
   comma.  Everyone could choose their own rule, I couldn't find a respectful 
   authority that has declared such rule.

   Frankly, I deem this unnecessary since it's out-of-context.  Also note 
   this, I couldn't find any British sources that have this function.

I used to use comma-before-too, but from now on, I would only use commas for 
emphases.
