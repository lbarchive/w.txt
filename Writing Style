                                Writing Style


A. Header Line

    Header Line is the first line of text file with four elements, evenly 
    spaced, from left to right, created date, name, copyright, updated date.

B. Title Line and Description Line

    Two lines are centered and have one gap line between them, two blank lines 
    around them.  The Description Line is optional.
    
    Title Line should at least match filename, for example, 
    Computer/Programming/C/Coding Style. The Title Line should be at least 
    "Coding Style," but "Coding Style for C" would be more complete.

C. TOP-LEVEL SECTIONS

    First-level sections are centered and ALL CAPS with two blank line 
    margins.

D. Second-Level Sections

    Second-level sections are centered and Title Cased with one blank line 
    margins.

E. Paragraphs, Literal Block, Lists

    Paragraphs and lists have no left margin, Literal Block has 2-space.
    Sentences are separated by 2 spaces.

F. Indentations

    Each level of indentation is 4 spaces.

G. Links and Footnotes

    - Use "[n]" as marks, where n is a digit, placed one space after the 
      linked text.
    - An "[n] URL" line is placed right after the paragraph on the same 
      indentation level.
    - If same URL is linked more than once, n is an upper case alphabet, and 
      only the first linking has the URL line.
    - For footnotes, n is a character other than digit or alphabet,
      following the same rules as links.
