                            Contributing to w.txt


w.txt is for my personal writings, I do appreciate some contributions, but it 
would have to be limited, because it must be my writings.

Definitely acceptable contributions are:

- fixes of typos and grammatical errors
- fixes of broken links
- fixes of codes in entries
- fixes of formatting

The followings are better to bring up in issues than pull requests:

- any forms of rewritings for any purposes
- reformatting and typesetting
- correcting errors other than ones from previous list
- new entries

All of above would not be my writings, please open an issue and give me the 
relevant informations.
