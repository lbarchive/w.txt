                          A Good Capture of Terminal


Here are some of my thoughts or guidelines about making a good screenshot or 
screencast of activities in terminal window. I can't say that I am an expert 
of producing great quality of images or animated GIFs, but I have seen many 
and produced quite a number myself.

This is not a step-by-step guide about what commands or tools to use, but what 
end result can demonstrate the better. It's a list of bullet points, to put it 
simply.


                                   KISS KAT


* KISS

    Don't over do it, "Keep it simple, stupid [1]."

    [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle

* KAT

    First of all, the focus is the terminal programs, so crop out the 
    decoration border or take time to determine the exact terminal window 
    region to record. No, it doesn't save much in terms of file size, but it 
    looks cleaner.

    You probably have great wallpaper, but really don't need to capture it,
    and turn off window transparency and any eye candies of desktop 
    environment.

    Leave out unrelated parts, Keep All in Terminal.


                                  THE FOCUS


* No need for the typing

    Almost all the GIFs have captured the typing process. Do viewers really 
    need to watch you typing? One might argue that the process guides the 
    viewer mentally as their eyes follow, well, it could be.

    Why not just take screenshots of the complete command typed and the result 
    of execution, give two frames longer delays? The benefits are

      a. smaller size and
      b. clean cuts, literally.

* Prompt too fancy

    There are a lot of prompt tools/styles, such as VCS status or date/time.  
    Do your viewers need such distractions? Here is a good example of the 
    distractions [1].

    Consider the following simplest prompt before the capture,

      PS1='$ '

    Remember it's the commands and the outputs that everyone wants, not your 
    colorful and informative prompt about your current environment, that has 
    nothing to do with the program.

    However, if the topic is the prompt, then by all means.


                               THE RIGHT MEDIUM


* Screenshot or literal block?

    If the output is simple text, that is no colors, perhaps a direct 
    copy-and-paste would serve better than a screenshot.

    This example [1] put commands and outputs in literal blocks, do you need 
    screenshots? And the viewers can try out by easily copy the commands and 
    paste into their terminals.

* Screenshot or Screencast?

    If it's not interactive, simple screenshots could be better. But it's no 
    harm to use animated GIFs for a serial commands.

    This is one screenshot [1] of three commands, clean result, there is no 
    need for animation.

                                OTHER THOUGHTS


* Size matters

    Try to resize the terminal window, probably size down, minimize unused 
    terminal space. Make sure the image size won't be scaled down in the 
    rendered HTML.

    Animated GIFs are nice if used properly, longer play time doesn't mean 
    better or comprehensive. Keep it short and clean, and split into parts if 
    necessary.

    Also beware of the font size, choose a proper size, because not everyone 
    is used to your terminal font.

* Delay matters

    Make sure the viewers have enough time to at least skimming over the 
    content.

    If you record, wait for a reasonable time before next command; if you 
    produce from still frames, choose good delays.
