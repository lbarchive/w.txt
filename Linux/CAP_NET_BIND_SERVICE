                             CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE


                                   PURPOSE


A process with CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE permission is allowed to, from 
capabilities(7):

    Bind a socket to Internet domain privileged ports (port numbers less than 
    1024).

In other words, the process can bind a socket to a privileged port such as 
port 80 without being a privileged user's process, that is a normal user can 
run a program which can open any ports in range of 0/1-1023.


                                    setcap


To grant the permission to a file, setcap can be used in the following 
example:

    # setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=ep program
    # getcap program  # to confirm

Where `=ep` means raising Effective and Permitted masks, and lowering 
Inheritable mask, which should be desired here, see cap_from_text(3). Note 
that the capability name is case insensitive.


                                capsh --addamb


The setcap will not work if, for instance, the program is a script that 
requires an interpreter. You will need to grant the capability on the 
interpreter, which might not be ideal.

With kernel 4.3+ (2015-11-01), "Ambient capabilities [1]" (2015-03-15) is 
supported, see capability(7); and the upcoming release -- possibly version 
2.26 -- of libcap, whose capsh can manipulate the ambient capabilities sets, 
see an explanation [1] for details.
