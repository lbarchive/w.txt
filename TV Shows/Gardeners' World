                               Gardeners' World

                                   BBC (UK)


Gardeners' World is my favorite gardening show, it's informative even I don't 
live in UK.  It's presented by the main presenter, currently Monty Don with 
two golden retrievers Nigel and Nellie, and several presenters.

The show has a fixed location, Monty's garden, and it's one of many reasons I 
love this show, because we, the viewers, follow the progress of his garden, 
watch it grows or its failures, even avid gardeners can fail.  Quite often, he 
will start some experiments, to test out things.

We watched Monty building the pool through out a season, then changes in 
following seasons.  Boxwood blight hitting his boxes, and this year, they were 
taken out, we saw the decisions and changes.

It's real, alive, not just a segment.

Other presents take us to gardens in UK, Europe, or the other places in the 
world.  They interview, or they present special educational topics on the 
plant life and various things.

And Jobs for the Weekend, they are reminders for the British gardeners.

Of course, the two adorable dogs, they do their parts, carrying things for 
Monty or chasing the tennis ball.
