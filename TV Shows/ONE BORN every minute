                            ONE BORN every minute

                                Channel 4 (UK)


It's a sister show of 24 Hours in A&E, similar production and presentation.

The show delivers -- no pun intended -- the reality of baby birth, from the 
false-alarm contractions to the baby is held in parent's arms.  It shows 
nearly uncensored steps in the process, tells the stories of the mother, the 
father, if not missing, and the family and friends.

The contractions, the balloons, the pain, the screams, the balls, the yells, 
the you-did-this-to-me to the new dads-to-be, the loves, and the babies, of 
courses.  Not every mother has great support, the reality, but even she is 
alone, she would still have the warmth from the mid-wives.

Also the mid-wives, their cares to the mothers, and, sometimes, the fathers, 
their tea time with other mid-wives, silly fun times in office, singing and 
occasionally dancing.

The only thing I don't like to see is C-section, especially when the scalpel 
slicing open the abdomen to the point the baby is being pulled out.  Those are 
scary and no mosaics, you get to see every bit.
