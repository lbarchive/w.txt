                            Good Television Shows


This is a list of television shows that I consider they are still worth to sit 
your butt down and waste for an hour or half of that time, and they are 
recommended.

I once have a conversation with someone on YouTube, a commenter told me 
television shows are mind poison.  I also seem to recall someone telling me 
watching television is wasting of time.

Frankly, I kind of agree with those opinions, but good shows do exist and if 
you have time to kill, turning on television does the job.
